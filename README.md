# custom-numpad
My first keyboard pcb for a standard numpad layout. Uses a 4x5 array of MX Cherry compatable switches for better customisability over a standard 17-key numpad.
The design is based on the [discipad](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipad) but was modified to use a full array and a Pro Micro 5V.
